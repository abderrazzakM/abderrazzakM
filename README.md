# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! üëã
Hi there! I‚Äôm Abderrazzak Moussaid, a Data Science enthusiast and university student passionate about Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Visualization. At 19 years old, I am continuously working to expand my skills and knowledge in data science and analytics through real-world projects. My goal is to build expertise in data-driven solutions and, eventually, establish a competitive AI-driven company in financial analytics.

## üíº Projects

### 1. Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium
   - **Description**: This project demonstrates my abilities to create detailed and insightful data visualizations using Python libraries such as **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for static data analysis, and **Folium** for mapping and geospatial analysis.
   - **Key Skills**: Data Visualization, Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
   - **Purpose**: To showcase the power of visual representation in communicating complex data insights.

### 2. Analyzing Wildfire Activities in Australia
   - **Description**: This analysis focuses on understanding wildfire patterns in Australia through data preprocessing, exploration, and feature analysis. The project involves extracting key insights from datasets to understand factors affecting wildfire frequency and intensity.
   - **Key Skills**: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Python
   - **Purpose**: To gain expertise in environmental data analysis and provide meaningful insights that could inform policy or further research.

### 3. Decision Tree Classification - Drug Effectiveness Prediction
   - **Description**: In this project, I applied a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict drug effectiveness based on patient data (age, sex, BP, cholesterol). The project highlights my understanding of supervised learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
   - **Key Skills**: Machine Learning, Decision Trees, Scikit-Learn, Data Preprocessing
   - **Purpose**: To explore classification techniques in healthcare and learn about model accuracy evaluation.

### 4. Real Estate Price Prediction using Decision Tree Regression
   - **Description**: This project involves using a **Decision Tree Regressor** to predict real estate prices, aiming to understand the relationships between various factors (such as location, area, and price). The model was evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error.
   - **Key Skills**: Regression Analysis, Scikit-Learn, Decision Trees
   - **Purpose**: To develop predictive modeling skills in a financial context, relevant to real estate analytics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Skills
